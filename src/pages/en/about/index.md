    CACR gives us a greater possibility of cooperation with related national
    organizations for cancer research in other countries in Europe and the world
    (BACR, ASEICA, MOT, AACR, etc.). In addition, we wish to strengthen
    connections between members of EACR in Croatia, but primarily to link
    researchers and as the Society to gain recognition in the field of cancer
    research as well as to enhance accessibility of the Society for young
    researchers.
